            <h2>Surveying</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> 
                Throughout our time in the Fleming geography information science application specialist program we competed something known as survey camp. Its a one week compact program where we
                implement the skills and knowledge we gained from our book work and classes into a real hands on activity with the surveying equipment. This made use more comfortable with the equipment and
                a leg up against other graduate with no equipment experience. Us as students will be able to handle this equipment with ease. For our survey camp we got hands on experience with a total station 
                and a surveying level. Of witch we completed a closed interior angle traverse survey with the total station and a leveling traverse with the level.
            </p>

            <h2>Survey Camp</h2>
            <h3>Survey Traverse using a Total Station and a Leveling Traverse using a level</h3>
            <p> 
               For the total station traverse we competed a interior closed angle traverse with 12 survey station using a total station and a prsim rod. 
               The process included the following process for each of the 12 survey stations. First we get the total station set up at the survey station by 
               first leveling and lining up the tripod above the survey station nail (position marked for total station position) and leveling the total station 
               once its been fastened to the tripod we double check that the total station is leveled and that it is centered above the nail. Next we proceed to 
               turn on the total station and take reading of the interior ange from the previous survey station and the next survey station by reading the prsim 
               rods location at both points getting both the interior angle and the distance to both survey station. once the readings are record we proceed to 
               the next station and repeat the process for all 12 survey stations.<br><br>

               Next for the leveling traverse we use a Stadia Rod to measure the heights at the designated points along the traverse. What we did was set up our 
               tripod for the level at a position that can see the Stadia rod at both our first point and the second point. Once the process of leveling is done 
               and the level is secured atop the tripod we can take the readings from the Stadia rod at both the backsight and foresight and calculating the both 
               the height of the instrument and the elevation. We proceed to to this for each of the designated points until we return to our starting point. 
               Then we complete final calculates. <br><br>
               Overall the main takeaways is that we have had hands on experience with real surveying tools and will be prime 
               for experienced professionals to fully train us and we will be using these tools in no time.
