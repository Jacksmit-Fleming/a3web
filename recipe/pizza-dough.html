						<li>
							Turn your oven light on to create a warm place for the pizza dough to rise.
						</li>

						<li>
							Separate your starter into two parts: one to feed and one for the pizza dough. You'll need
							approximately one cup of starter for this recipe; put it in your largest mixing bowl.  <br>

						</li>

						<li>
							Pour the warm water over the starter and then sprinkle the yeast over it. (This will give the
							yeast a bit of a head start.)  <br>
							<img class="pizza-steps" src="../img/water_and_yeast_added.jpeg" alt="Images showing how to add water and yeast to the dough" />
						</li>

						<li>
							Add the flour and the salt to the bowl. <br>
							<img class="pizza-steps" src="../img/flour_and_salt_added.jpeg" alt="Images showing how to add flour and salt to the dough" />
						</li>

						<li>
							Mix everything together with your hands. It will initially look messy before forming into a
							good dough. <br>
							<img class="pizza-steps" src="../img/mixing_by_hand.jpeg" alt="Images showing the next step of mixing the dough" />
						</li>

						<li class="direction-item">
							The dough should feel slightly sticky but not really stick to your hands or the counter. Don't
							be afraid to add a little more flour or water to get the right consistency. <br>
							<img class="pizza-steps" src="../img/slightly_sticky_dough.jpeg" alt="Images showing dough placed on counter" />
						</li>

						<li>
							Knead the dough for 7 minutes. This is an excellent opportunity to work out any frustration
							you've been feeling lately. The dough will become smooth and elastic. <br>

						</li>

						<li>
							Grease your second-largest mixing bowl with olive oil using your hands. Lightly coat the
							dough in oil as well, put in the bowl and loosely cover it. <br>

						</li>

						<li>
							Loosely cover the bowl, put it in the oven and leave it there for 3-4 hours. <br>

						</li>

						<li>
							The dough will increase in size and become softer. It's now ready to use. <br>
